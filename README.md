This repository is a **customized fork** of the original *Build a Large Language Model (From Scratch)* project. It contains code, notes, and experiments for **learning, pretraining, and finetuning GPT-like Large Language Models (LLMs)** from the ground up.

The project follows a **from-scratch, educational approach**, focusing on understanding how LLMs work internally by implementing every core component step by step using **Python and PyTorch**.

## 📘 Original Inspiration

This project is based on the book:

**Build a Large Language Model (From Scratch)**
Author: *Sebastian Raschka*
Publisher: Manning (2024)

* Book: [https://www.manning.com/books/build-a-large-language-model-from-scratch](https://www.manning.com/books/build-a-large-language-model-from-scratch)


## 🚀 What This Repository Contains

* GPT-style Transformer implementation from scratch
* Text tokenization & dataloaders
* Self-attention & multi-head attention
* GPT pretraining loop
